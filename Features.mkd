### Help ###
            <F1>      Open help page


### Navigation ###
            o         Open one or more URLs in current tab. Multiple URLs can be separated with ','.
                      The first URL is opened in the current tab, and all other URLs are opened in new tabs.
                      There are some powerful features here:
                      1, AutoComplete support:
                      <Down>,<Up>   Navigate next/previous link. (You can change the behavior in config, please see http://goo.gl/koFEh)
                      <Tab>,<S-Tab> Navigate the next/previous 10th link. (You can change the behavior in config, please see http://goo.gl/koFEh)
                      <Enter>       Open selected link in current tab.
                      <C-Enter>     Open selected link in new tab. and keep AutoComplete list open so you can open another link.
                      <C-[0-9]>     Open links marked with red number.
                                    The red number is the relative index of the currently selected link.
                                    E.g: you can use <C-5> the open the 5th link, <C-7> to open the 7th one.
                                    It would be really cool when works with <Tab>, <S-Tab>

                      Btw, you could turn off AutoComplete if you want. Please refer Wiki for how to.

                      2, Relative path support:
                      Try to type '/admin', '..', '../..', '../../rails', './wiki' when visiting `http://github.com/jinzhu/vrome`
                      It is supposed to open http://github.com/admin, http://github.com/jinzhu ... for you.
                      I believe it would be really useful for website administrator, developer or even everyone.

                      3, Search Engine:
                      Try `google vrome` to search vrome with google. `google` is the search engine name, `vrome` is the keyword.
                      `google`, `answers`, `yahoo`, `wikipedia`, `bing`, `twitter` are built in search engines.
                      You could define you own one, checkout [Customize Your Vrome](https://github.com/jinzhu/vrome/wiki/customize-your-vrome) for how to.

                      You can even omit the search engines name, then would search it with the default search engine.
                      The default one is google, you can change it in Vrome's option page.

            O         Opens one or more URL in current tab, based on current location. (refer `o` for more)

            p         Open a URL based on the selected or clipboard contents in current tab.

                      You can go to a marked URL in the current tab with go{a-zA-Z0-9} or in a new tab with gn{a-zA-Z0-9}.
                      e.g: When you visiting `http://github.com`, you could add `github.com` to quick mark `g` with `Mg`,
                      Then you can use `gog` to open `http://github.com` in current tab. or `gng` to open it in a new tab.
       go{a-zA-Z0-9}  Open marked URL in current tab. (refer M{a-zA-Z0-9} for more)
       gn{a-zA-Z0-9}  Open marked URL in a new tab. (refer M{a-zA-Z0-9} for more)

       m{a-zA-Z}      Set mark at the cursor position. Marks a-z are local to the buffer, whereas A-Z are valid between buffers.
                      e.g: When You are reading the first paragraph of a article, if you found some fun want to check back later.
                      You could save the current cursor position with `ma`.
                      After finish reading, you could jump back to the first paragraph quickly with `'a`.
       '{a-zA-Z}      Jump to the mark. Marks a-z are local to the buffer, whereas A-Z are valid between buffers.
                      (refer m{a-zA-Z} for more)


### Hints Mode ###
            f         Start Hint mode, All visible links/input would be given a number.
                      You could filter those elements with the number given or keyword match the element's content.
                      When there are only one element match, the element would be opened in current tab if it is a link.
                      Otherwise it would be foucsed on or clicked.

                      e.g: if there is a link named `Gmail`, you can type `ma` to filter and open it.
                      One more thing, Press <Enter> would open current highlighted element.
                      <C-Enter> would open all available hints in current page.

                      You can use the `hintkeys` vromerc setting to change the characters used for 'numbering', the default value
                      for this setting is 0123456789. So, for example, `set hintkeys=asdfghjkl;` would label the hints using
                      the keys of the home row. Values for hintkey do not need to be 10 characters long: `set hintkeys=asdf`
                      will also work.

                      Tip: Any keys not listed in hintkeys can be used for filtering. Filtering is not case-sensitive, but
                      hintkeys are. So if your hintkeys are "asdfg" you can use filtering to select the `Gmail` link in 
                      the above example by typing `MA`, and if your hintkeys are 'ASDF' you can type `ma` to select the `Gmail` 
                      link and you would need to type `GA` to select the link tagged with those keys.

                      Finally, you can set hintkeysdisplayuppercase if you want the hintkey 'numbers' to be converted to 
                      uppercase before they're displayed, but to still act like lowercase hintkeys. This is helpful for 
                      readability The default value for this setting is 0. If you add `set hintkeysdisplayuppercase=1`
                      in your vromerc the links will be 'numbered' A,S,D,F... but you will still type a,s,d,f,... to select them. 

            F         Start Hint mode, but open links in new tabs. (refer `f` for more)
            <M-f>     Start Hint mode, but open multiple links in a new tab. (refer `f` for more)

            Also there are some extend commands when in the [input box]:
                ?     Show information about an element.
                      For example, type `?gmail` in the input box, it would search all elements match gmail like normal.
                      If there are one element matched, it would show the element's details, usually it is the element's html.
                ;     Focus an element. (refer `?` in Hints extend Mode for more)
                [     Copy selected element's url if exist. [hint] `[` looks like the C in Copy.
                      (refer `?` in Hints extend Mode for more)
                {     Copy selected element's text. [hint] `{` also looks like the C in Copy.
                      (refer `?` in Hints Mode for more)
                !     Filter links doesn't match keyword. (refer `?` in Hints Mode for more)
